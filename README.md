# Alchemist Theme

*Elixir optimised Sublime Text colour scheme.*

---

Created as my favourite ST theme's have some minor issues with aspects of the Elixir Syntax. This is a work in progress. Contributions welcome!

## Installation

I'd recommend cloning directly from GitHub, that way contributions and updates will be easier to manage:

```
> cd Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages
> git clone https://github.com/nathanhornby/alchemist-theme.git alchemist-theme
```

'alchemist-theme' should now be available in Sublime Text under 'Color Scheme' in 'Preferences'.

*n.b. I'll eventually add the scheme to Sublime Text package manager, once I consider it more complete.*
