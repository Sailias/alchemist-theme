# Alchemist Theme

*Elixir optimised Sublime Text colour scheme.*

---

Created as my favourite ST theme's have some minor issues with aspects of the Elixir syntax. This is a work in progress.

**Contributions welcome!**

## Sublime Text theme installation

I'd recommend cloning directly from GitHub, that way contributions and updates will be easier to manage:

```
> cd Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 3/Packages
> git clone https://github.com/nathanhornby/alchemist-theme.git alchemist-theme
```

'alchemist-theme' should now be available in Sublime Text under 'Color Scheme' in 'Preferences'.

To complete the experience you can also grab my settings file [here](https://gist.github.com/nathanhornby/2e0817cedf0981e06ad5).

*n.b. I'll eventually add the scheme to Sublime Text package manager, once I consider it more complete.*

Now complete with a bonus iTerm theme with the same palette! (comes to life when using [Oh My Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/))
